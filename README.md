# NTUT OOP Homework: Calculator Testing

This repository uses JUnit 5 and gradle to test the **Calculator.jar**, which is created by using IntelliJ. The step-by-step slide can be found here:

The video tutorials of creating a Java Calculator are on YouTube:

[1. Buidling GUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_L-gThl01Y) 

[2. Writing Your Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHU8P2tzG4)

[3. Testing using JUnit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jaVOGnH4jo)

The default jar file will fail all the tests. You need to upload your own **Caculator.jar** to pass all the tests!

## How to test on Your own computer

First, install gradle on your computer and run the command
```
gradle test
```
gradle will compile your **Calculator.jar** with the test file **CalculatorFormTest.java**, which is under the folder "**src/test/java/**"
